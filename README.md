# Synchaev

## Introduction

**Synchaev** is a user interface for interacting with synthetic environments generated by LLMs. It enables researchers and developers to simulate, observe, and record interactions between agents and environments for experimentation and analysis.

## Setup

To install Synchaev, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/synchaev.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Install the package in editable mode:**

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

### Launch the application with Streamlit:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-<your_key>"
streamlit run ./app.py
```

### Record Agent-Environment conversations:

```bash
python ./record.py
```

## Report

A detailed report on our experiments aimed at enhancing LLMs as general-purpose agents is available [here](https://github.com/UptownResearch/synchaev/blob/main/assets/Report.pdf).
