Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then write down:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\nDO NOT write this pattern unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself.\n"}, {"role": "agent", "content": "Ok."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Insert 'Another Plant' with 'Muskegon' into 'Power Plants and Rivers' table with power of '15' (in MW).\nThe name of this table is Power Plants and Rivers, and the headers of this table are Plant,River,Power ( MW )."}, {"role": "agent", "content": "To insert a new plant with the name 'Another Plant' and the power of 15 into the 'Power Plants and Rivers' table, we can use the SQL INSERT INTO statement.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Power Plants and Rivers (Plant, River, Power) VALUES ('Another Plant', 'Muskegon', 15)\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Plants and Rivers (Plant, River, Power) VALUES ('Another Plant', 'Muskegon', 15)' at line 1"}, {"role": "agent", "content": "Apologies for the confusion.
