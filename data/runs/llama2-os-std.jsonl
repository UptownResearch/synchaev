It seems that the `cut` command is not working as expected. The error message indicates that the delimiter must be a single character, but the `cut` command is trying to use a delimiter that is a string of multiple characters.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the `--delimiter` option of the `cut` command to specify the delimiter character. For example:\n```bash\nnum_errors=$(echo \"$line\" | cut -d''-f 3)\n```\nThis will tell `cut` to use a space character as the delimiter, so that it can properly parse the event type field.\n\nAlternatively, you can use other delimiters such as a tab or a comma, depending on what is most appropriate for your log file format. For example:\n```bash\nnum_errors=$(echo \"$line\" | cut -d'\\t' -f 3)\n```\nor\n```bash\nnum_errors=$(echo \"$line\" | cut -d','-f 3)\n```\nI hope this helps!
