Then, iterate over the keys in the male dictionary, calculate the ratio for each movie by dividing the female count by the male count (assigning a ratio of 0 for movies with no female actors) and sum these ratios. Finally, divide the sum of the ratios by the number of movies to get the average ratio. \n\nHere is a Python pseudocode illustrating this process:\n\n```python\nmale_dict = {...} # replace with male count output\nfemale_dict = {...} # replace with female count output\n\ntotal_ratio = 0\n\nfor movie_id in male_dict:\n    total_ratio += female_dict.get(movie_id, 0) / male_dict[movie_id]\n\naverage_ratio = total_ratio / len(male_dict)\n```\n\nPlease note that this method assumes that there are no movies with no male actors. If there are such movies, you would need to handle this to avoid division by zero errors. \n\nUnfortunately, due to the restriction of executing only one SQL statement at a time, I cannot provide a final SQL solution to get the average ratio directly."}, {"from": "human", "value": "END"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Alright, feel free to ask if you have more questions in the future.
